GSoC participants, being human, will sometimes get sick or have something come
up in their life (i.e. death in the family) during GSoC and this can affect
their performance. A student's (or mentor's) health is more important than a
GSoC project.

Do's:

+   Encourage the participant to focus on their health concerns as their priority.
+   Provide reasonable accommodations and understanding.

Dont's:

+   Pry into the details of the situation. It's none of your business.
+   Ask for a doctor's note or proof.
+   Make promises about extensions outside the normal GSoC dates.
+   Require students to withdraw. This is their choice.

When evaluating students, be cognizant of the amount of time they have put in.
A student who has produced good work for most of an evaluation period may be
passed. A student who has only spent a few days working shouldn't be passed. If
a student needs to take a week off, that shouldn't be an automatic fail.
Evaluate the big picture. Students should only be passed for work they've
already done, not work they might do. Failing a student who has a special
circumstance isn't easy, but might be the right thing to do.

Note: Students must still complete their evaluation in order to be passed.
